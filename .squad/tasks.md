## 🟡 Mid Priority

- [ ] **RC browser UI — review and improvement pass** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  Review the RC mobile web client (`Squad.SDK/rc-client/index.html`) with fresh eyes and identify
  opportunities to improve the experience: layout, typography, spacing, readability of markdown
  content, chat bubble polish, activity indicators, input bar ergonomics, color/contrast, and
  anything else that feels rough. Propose and implement the best improvements. Focus on the phone
  viewport (small screen, touch targets).

---

## 🔴 High Priority

- [ ] **WinGet — smoke-test installer on clean VM** *(Owner: you — manual step)*
  Run `.\installer\build-installer.ps1 -Version 1.0.0` (requires Inno Setup 6 installed locally),
  then install on a clean Windows VM with only Node.js pre-installed. Verify: launcher starts,
  SDK bridge connects, workspaces resolve correctly from `%LocalAppData%\SquadDash\app\`.
  **Blocks:** GitHub Release, WinGet submission.

## 🟡 Mid Priority

- [x] **WinGet — create GitHub Release v1.0.0** *(Owner: you — manual step)*
  After smoke-test passes: create GitHub Release `v1.0.0`, attach the installer `.exe` and its
  SHA256 hash. The public download URL is required for `wingetcreate`.
  **Blocked by:** smoke-test passing.

- [ ] **WinGet — generate and submit manifest** *(Owner: Jae Min — automated once release exists)*
  Run `wingetcreate new <installer-url>`, add `OpenJS.NodeJS` as a `PackageDependencies` entry
  in the installer manifest YAML, open PR to `microsoft/winget-pkgs`.
  **Blocked by:** GitHub Release v1.0.0 existing with a stable download URL.

- [ ] **WinGet — document Node.js prerequisite** *(Owner: Jae Min)*
  `runPrompt.js` calls `node` from PATH — Node.js is required but not bundled.
  Update `README.md` to document this prerequisite clearly. The WinGet manifest will list
  `OpenJS.NodeJS` as a dependency but a README callout helps users who install manually.

- [ ] **WinGet — Phase 2: release automation** *(Owner: Jae Min)*
  Create `.github/workflows/release.yml`: on `v*` tag push, run `dotnet publish`, bundle
  installer, upload to GitHub Release, run `wingetcreate update`, open PR to winget-pkgs
  automatically. Requires `WINGET_PKGS_PAT` repo secret.
  **Blocked by:** Phase 1 (manual release) succeeding at least once.

- [ ] **WinGet — write RELEASING.md runbook** *(Owner: Jae Min)*
  Document the full release checklist: bump version, tag, let automation run, verify winget PR.
  Include manual fallback steps. Useful for the first few releases before automation is trusted.

## 🔵 Low Priority

- [ ] **SubSquads — investigate and expose in UI** *(Owner: Orion Vale → Lyra Morn)*
  The `squad streams` / workstreams feature was bridged (subsquads_list/activate) but the
  Workspace menu items were removed because they only printed to the transcript with no visible
  feedback. Investigate what `squad streams` / `.squad/workstreams.json` enables in the current
  Squad SDK version, then design and implement proper UI (e.g. a dynamic submenu showing
  configured workstreams, the active one highlighted, click to activate).

- [ ] **Personal Squad — investigate and expose in UI** *(Owner: Orion Vale → Lyra Morn)*
  The `squad personal` feature was bridged (personal_list/personal_init) but the Workspace menu
  item was removed — it printed to transcript only with no visible feedback. Investigate what
  "personal squad" means in the current Squad SDK version (cross-workspace personal agents stored
  in the global Squad data dir), then design and implement useful UI if the feature has real value
  for SquadDash users.
